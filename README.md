 ## Mars Climate Orbiter Challenge
This project addresses the Mars Climate Orbiter Challenge, involving debugging, refactoring, and enhancing JavaScript functions for spacecraft trajectory calculations. The initial functions contain unit mismatch issues, leading to incorrect calculations.

### Solution
Debugged functions to fix unit mismatches and ensure consistent units.
Refactored code for readability and maintainability.
Enhanced calculations to throw errors for invalid input parameters.

### What I Learned
Creating robust calculations requires careful attention to unit consistency and conversion factors. By adding checks for invalid input parameters, the calculations become more reliable and user-friendly.
